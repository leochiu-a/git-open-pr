# Usage Guide

This guide demonstrates how to use Git PR AI Tool in your daily development workflow with practical examples and best practices.

## Basic Workflow

The typical workflow with Git PR AI Tool follows these steps:

1. **Create a branch** based on JIRA ticket or task description
2. **Make your changes** and commit them
3. **Create a Pull Request** with automatic JIRA integration
4. **Update PR description** with AI assistance (optional)
5. **Get AI code review** for quality assurance (optional)

## Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: JIRA Ticket Workflow

Starting with a JIRA ticket `PROJ-123: Implement user authentication`:

```bash
# 1. Create branch from JIRA ticket
git create-branch --jira PROJ-123
# AI generates: feat/PROJ-123-implement-user-auth

# 2. Make your changes
# ... implement authentication features ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication with JWT"

# 3. Create Pull Request
git open-pr
# Creates PR with title: "[PROJ-123] Implement user authentication"

# 4. Update description with AI (optional)
git update-pr-desc "Focus on security best practices and JWT implementation"

# 5. Get AI review (optional)
git pr-review
```

### Example 2: Git Diff Workflow

When you have uncommitted changes and want to create a branch:

```bash
# 1. Make some changes first
# ... modify files ...

# 2. Create branch based on your changes
git create-branch --git-diff
# AI analyzes your changes and suggests: fix/update-user-validation

# 3. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update user validation logic"

# 4. Create Pull Request
git open-pr
# Creates PR with title based on branch name
```

### Example 3: Custom Prompt Workflow

When working on a task without a JIRA ticket:

```bash
# 1. Create branch from description
git create-branch --prompt "Add dark mode support to the application"
# AI generates: feat/add-dark-mode-support

# 2. Implement the feature
# ... add dark mode functionality ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add dark mode toggle and theme switching"

# 3. Create Pull Request
git open-pr
# Creates PR with title: "Add dark mode support"

# 4. Enhance with AI description
git update-pr-desc
```

### Example 4: Branch Renaming Workflow

When you want to rename your current branch:

```bash
# You're on a branch with a generic name like "feature-branch"
git branch
# * feature-branch

# Rename based on JIRA ticket
git create-branch --jira PROJ-456 -m
# Renames to: feat/PROJ-456-optimize-database-queries

# Or rename based on changes
git create-branch --git-diff -m
# Analyzes changes and renames accordingly
```

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Existing PRs

```bash
# Update description of existing PR
git update-pr-desc "Add context about performance improvements"

# Review existing PR
git pr-review

# Review someone else's PR
git pr-review https://github.com/company/repo/pull/789
```

### Branch Naming Best Practices

Branch names generated by the AI mainly follow the [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) conventions, using standard type prefixes:

**Common Types:**

- `feat/`: New features
- `fix/`: Bug fixes
- `docs/`: Documentation updates
- `style/`: Code formatting changes (not affecting logic)
- `refactor/`: Code refactoring (not adding features or fixing bugs)
- `test/`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore/`: Maintenance tasks (such as build process, tooling, etc.)

**Examples:**

```bash
# JIRA ticket: "Add user registration form"
git create-branch --jira PROJ-123
# → feat/PROJ-123-add-user-registration

# Git diff shows bug fixes
git create-branch --git-diff
# → fix/resolve-authentication-timeout

# Custom prompt: "Update API documentation"
git create-branch --prompt "Update API documentation"
# → docs/update-api-documentation
```
